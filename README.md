# Zombie-Escape-Game
The IA basics in Lua. Could you escape from the zombies?

This is my **third workshop in programming a video game**.

The workshop leads me to realize a shooter game where zombies have a basic IA.

Here are the features the workshop helps to put in place:

- View and move a player
- Zombies try to chase the player when he approaches them

**Here are the features I have added:**

- Game music background
- Sound effects (bullet shoots and zombies sound)
- Graphics improvement
- Use of shadows library
- The player can shoot the zombies!
- Menu, gameover and victory screens
